# mudclient

A MUD is a text-only multiplayer roleplay game.

This client will enable you to connect to a mud that uses the Telnet protocol.

There are of course many very sophisticated mud clients available elsewhere, the purpose however of this one is so that I can learn Python.

# Intended Features

- saved character profiles
- triggers
- macros
- MXP support
- back channel comms for multiplay
